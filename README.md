# GMW Model 5304 Electromagnet
--------
This repository provides a 3D CAD drawing of the electromagnet.
The drawing was done by measuring the device. The objective was to facilitate the drawing of accessories to hold samples and probes.
Some parts were simplified such as the coil and the pole screws.

-----
Measurements of the magnetic field across the poles and the magnetic field vs. the current will be added to this repository next.
