# GMW Model 5304 Electromagnet
--------
This repository provides a 3D CAD drawing of the electromagnet.
The drawing was done by measuring the device. The objective was to facilitate the drawing of accessories to hold samples and probes.
Some parts were simplified such as the coil and the pole screws.

A file with measurements of the magnetic field across the poles and the magnetic field vs. the current is also provided.

A sample holder design is provided in repository 'Sample-Holders' named LAB-001-030.
This holder is design for gap between poles of 10 mm and configured for MOKE measurements.
